`Scrum` allows teams to deliver milestones as small pieces.

`Empirical work` is more like a science experiment. You try something, check out the results and if it didn't work you try something else.

Upfront planning is theoretical. Evolving design is both practical and tactical.

Scrum wants you to fail. In fact, it's known for the slogan "fail fast."

__Scrum Framework__
* Product owner priotizes a backlog of work.
* Team decides what work can be done next.
* Team develops and tests solutions until done.
* Team demonstrates its completed work.
* Team reflects on how it can improve.

`Daily Stand Up` Team meeting held each day

So Scrum mandates ceremony called the `retrospective`, where they can assess themselves and decide what to improve.

__Product Owner__
* Acts as the full-time business representative. (_They're not part-time team members. They show up every day, because they're contributing to the final product every day._)
* Reviews the team's work. (_They review all the work the team completes and either accepts it or asks the team to make changes._)
* Ensures highest value is delivered.

`Scrum Master` protects the team and protects the process. They balance the demands of the PO againts the need of the team. 

__Scrum Master__
* Keeps the team working at a sustainable pace. (_We don't want them to get burned out before they reach the finish line._)
* Acts as spokesperson for the team. (_Scrum Masters value transparency. They'll devise charts and boards to share the team's progress with anyone who's curious or interested in how they're doing. They're also the first escalation point when something gets in the way for the team._)
* Helps remove any roadblocks for the team. 
* Holds the team accountable to the product owner. 

`User Story` Detailed, valuable chunk of work a team can quickly deliver. When writing user stories, it's best to use Bill Wake's `INVEST` acronym as a guide.

__I - Independent__ It can be delivered separately from other stories and have value by itself. if you only have time to do one thing. 

__N - Negotiable__ Until the story is committed for work, it can be rewritten, changed, or canceled at any time. 

__V - Valuable__ It delivers value to the PO, stakeholders, and customers. Simply put, it's meaningful. 

__E - Estimable__ You must be able to estimate the size of the story in story points. That means that the story is descriptive enough so you know what has to be done to finish it. Only then can you understand the effort required. 

__S - Small__ The story is small enough to be completed in one sprint. 

__T - Testable__ The story provides enough information that you can develop tests for it. 

Simple format guide for user story 
```
<user role>, I want 
<users requirement> so that 
<desired benefit>
```

Example of functional user story 
```
<mobile customer>, I want 
<to create a profile> so that 
<future orders are faster to place>
```

Example for non-functional user story
```
As a developer, I want to upgrade the 
database software to the latest version 
so that we have a supported product. 
```
