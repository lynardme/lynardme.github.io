When I tried [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} for the first time I was impressed of the simplicity of its structure. The idea of no database involved it makes Jekyll very simple to use. And then, I heard about github pages where you can commit your code like ordinary github codes and from that point you can host your website automatically using the github pages system. 

Last time, I hosted my website in digital ocean paid $5 every month. It's not bad at all but because of the crisis we experience now of covid19 virus, every penny is worth much. 

Github pages supported and recommend Jekyll to create your static website as they simplified the build process meaning you don't have to worry about the deployment of your code to your infrastructure. Github pages will all do the work, you just commit your code and bang! you have a website up and running. 

#### Jekyll Themes

There's a lot of themes you can download and try to yourself.

There were many themes that were good. I tried a few of them like Jasper, End2end, etc but I feel like I don't learn just by using one these themes. So I decided to build on my own from scratch. I follow the [step-by-step tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/){:target="_blank"} from Jekyll website and from there I created my first basic jekyll website.

From this scaffold files, I improved my website to become what [lynard.me](https://lynard.me) looks right now. 

That's all folks, if you want to try you can you download a copy from my github repo [jekyll-basic](https://github.com/lynardme/jekyll-basic){:target="_blank"}
