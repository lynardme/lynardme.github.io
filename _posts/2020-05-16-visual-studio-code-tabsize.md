I'm organizing my self if I'm working on Javascript I will use Visual Studio Code and if I use Python I will use Sublime Text. I didn't use Visual Studio Code so often before and didn't know more on settings part. One problem is that I want to make the tabsize equal to 2 spaces only as oppose in my Sublime Text which had 4 spaces. 

##### Go to File -> Preferences

![](/assets/images/visual-studio-code-tabsize1.png){:class="img-fluid"} 

##### Settings - change the following
![](/assets/images/visual-studio-code-tabsize2.png){:class="img-fluid"} 

##### Eureka!!!
