I am always fascinated to learn about data science concept but not yet started to fully understand all the tools and technique to manipulate data. Today, I look again the tutorial about bokeh. [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org) is a visualization library and it's very flexible and powerful tool to visualize data. 

First thing first, install anaconda if you don't have. 

and then install bokeh 
```
pip install bokeh
```

### Run Jupyter notebook
Once everything setup, hit `jupyter notebook` in your terminal and create a new notebook. 
Write the code below to test if bokeh is installed properly. 

![image-title-here](/assets/images/all-set-bokeh.png){:class="img-fluid"} 

All set! 

Here's another example that generate a simple graph. 

![](/assets/images/first-plot-bokeh.png){:class="img-fluid"} 
![](/assets/images/first-plot-bokeh-graph.png){:class="img-fluid"} 

Wow it's time for you to try and have some fun with Bokeh and Jupyter notebook. 

### Ciao!
